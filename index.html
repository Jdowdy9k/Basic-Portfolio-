    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I'm a craftsman by trade and builder in general. I've always been creating or destroying things, often times
        destroying in order to create.
        And in case of the cartoon robot Models I build at least, this cycle of events tends to be never ending.
        I've always been a proponate of the philosophy "work hard, play harder" which could explain why I take my video
        games so seriously, also why I sometimes pass out with a tiny paint brush and robot in my hands.
        To sum me up in a word i would use "Adventurer" not because I travel a lot or wonder, but because my heart and
        mind are restless and i simply must see more.
