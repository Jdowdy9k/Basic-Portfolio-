            craftsman by trade
            and builder in general. I've always been creating or destroying things, often
            times destroying in order to create. And in case of the cartoon robot Models I build at least, this cycle of
            events tends to be never ending. I've always been a proponate of the philosophy "work hard, play harder"
            which could explain why I take
            my video games so seriously, also why I sometimes pass out with a tiny paint brush and robot in my hands.
            To sum me up in a word i would use "Adventurer" not because I travel a lot or wonder, but because my
            heart and mind are restless and i simply must see more.
